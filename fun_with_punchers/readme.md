## To start the locally running light node run:
```console
geth.exe --syncmode light --http
```

## To run the python once the node is running:
run testing_get_nft_info.py in visual studio code with the play button.
can alternatively run other files or run in console with
```console
python testing_get_nft_info.py
```

note* Not python3. Not sure why. I seem to have set things up such that python is the correct python3 to use.
